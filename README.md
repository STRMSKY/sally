# Sally: A Split Alice-Like Layout Keyboard

Sally is a personalized keyboard that I designed to meet my specific needs. It features: 
- physically split layout
- numeric row (useful for gaming)
- row staggered layout
- thumb cluster
- mostly 1u keys
- letter B is accessible in both right and left half

## Keyboard layout
My inspiration was Alice Keyboard. It consists of 59 keys (57 x 1u + 2 x 1.5u).
You can recreate it and modify by pasting ![KLE code](https://github.com/STRMSKY/sally/blob/main/sally_2_halves_raw_kle) to ![Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)

## Casing
My first idea was to have laser cut casing:

This design had few major flaws:
- need for sanding edges so casing won't cut your skin
- cost (1 part layers)
- stability (multiple part layer)
Eventually I simplified the design and adjusted it for 3D printing:

Files for both casings are (going to be) available in this repo.


## Wiring
