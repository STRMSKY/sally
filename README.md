# Sally: A Split Alice-Like Keyboard with Thumb Cluster

Sally is a personalized keyboard that I designed to meet my specific needs. It features a physically split layout, a numeric row (useful for gaming), a row staggered layout, a thumb cluster, and mostly 1u keys. Additionally, the letter B is accessible in the right half of the keyboard, which is a more common placement than you might think!

At this stage, I have created a keyboard layout that consists of 59 keys (including 2x 1.5u). You can see the layout in the image below:

Currently, there are a few things that I need to work on to bring Sally to life. Specifically, I need to:
- decide whether to use a custom PCB or handwiring with microcontrollers
- create a plate (for Cherry MX switches) and a case (ideally with tilt support)
- create a prototype 
- refine the design further

Tools:
- Keyboard Layout Editor http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/
- 3D render https://eswai.github.io/KL3V/kl3v.html
- Keyboard generator that may be handy for creating plates and PCBs https://github.com/benvallack/ergogen / https://ergogen.cache.works/

If you are interested in Sally - feel free to help me out!
